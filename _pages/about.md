Currently, I am a Senior student at [School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://seee.hust.edu.vn/), [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.vn/), majoring in Control and Automation Engineering. 
I am a member of laboratory [Mechatronics Engineering Group](https://www.facebook.com/mechatronicsengineeringgroup) leaded by Assoc.Prof Nguyen Tung Lam. My CV is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10HnMYvKKY3_-sVpk8afSS59d1ii1i4yY/view?usp=drive_link) 

Research Interest
======
My long-term research revolves around the developments of Robotics and Motion Control. Particularly, my current research focus is on a Six-wheel Driving/Six-wheel Steering ([6WD/6WS](https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=785401604312705&set=pcb.785403127645886)) vehicle. I have done a research on designing a Siding Mode Controller integrated with Extended State Observer for 6WD/6WS vehicle to change the lane. The subsequent work I am concerned is to develop a Fault-tolerant Driving Control to redistribute the longitudinal tyre force to wheels and Artificial Potential Fields to generate designed trajectory for lane changing maneuver.
